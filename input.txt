Bob bit big, bad bag. Ben bet Bob’s box. The box bore a bug, bot, and bar. Bit by bit, the bug bit Bob. Ben bled. Bob bawled. The bot bobbed and bid bye. Ben bit the bar, and the box broke. The bug bit Ben. Bob’s bow bent. Ben booed. The box was bare. Bob bid Ben buy a big bin. The bin bore a bat. The bat bit Ben. Bob bit the bat. The bat was bad. Ben bawled, and Bob bowed. The bug bit the bin. The bin bent. Ben bashed the bin. Bob begged Ben. Ben bashed the box. The box blew. Bob bawled big.

Ben ran back. Bob sat by the bay. The sun set. The bug buzzed. A bat flew by. Bob blinked. Ben bent low. The bin was busted. The bot beeped. Bob frowned. The wind blew. Ben sighed. A bird bobbed up. The bar broke. Bob’s boot was brown. Ben brushed back hair. The bin brimmed with bits. Bob balked. Ben bent. The bug bounced. Bob grabbed a bag. The bin banged shut. Ben backed off. The bot beeped twice. Bob stood. The bat was gone. The bay was bright. The box was blank. Ben blinked. Bob breathed.
